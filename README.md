# Memory Game

Classic memory game with PokÃ©mon theme. 

There are 3 difficulties and you have 60 seconds to beat each of them.

It is not possible to play very effectively on mobile devices, but for the sake of responsive design, it also looks decent on mobile.

Can you match the all PokÃ©mons? Have fun!
